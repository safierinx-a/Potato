Looking at potato price time series.

```{r}
setwd('C:/Users/APOORV/Downloads')
data <- read.csv("daily_wholesale_price_Potato-upto_apr_2015.csv")
print(data)
```
Let's only consider prices in Delhi and remove the na values and draw up a quick plot. I assume the NA values lie in between their adjacent values.
```{r}
delhi <- data[data$Centre_Name=='DELHI',]
dts <- ts(delhi$Price, frequency=365, start=c(2009,1,1))
library(imputeTS)
dts <- na_seadec(dts)
plot.ts(dts)

```
Looks Seasonal. Let's decompose.

```{r}
plot(decompose(dts))
```
Looks like there's a clear seasonality to the prices. Makes sense. I wonder if keeping potatoes in cold storage gives a net profit? Let's rummage up some quick stats? Let's look at the maximum possible profit that can be derived.
```{r}
r = max(dts)-min(dts)
r
s <- decompose(dts)$seasonal + decompose(dts)$random + decompose(dts)$trend - dts
plot(s)
dts
delhi
```
